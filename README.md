Disease Diagnosis Prediction
 Objective
Develop a predictive model to assess the likelihood of diseases such as diabetes or heart disease using patient medical data.

 Dataset
Sources:

PIMA Diabetes Dataset

Heart Disease Dataset

Type: Tabular medical data with clinical and diagnostic features.

 Steps
EDA: Analyze feature distributions and correlations with disease outcomes.

Preprocessing: Perform feature selection and scale data for optimal results.

Modeling: Train models like Gradient Boosting, SVM, and Neural Networks.

Evaluation: Use F1 Score and AUC-ROC curves to assess model performance.

Insights: Deliver data-driven recommendations for early diagnosis and intervention.

 Outcome
Accurate disease prediction models for diabetes or heart disease.

Interpretable results to assist healthcare professionals.

Supports early detection and informed medical decisions.
